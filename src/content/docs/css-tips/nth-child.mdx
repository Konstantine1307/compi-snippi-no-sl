## Useful CSS :nth-child Recipes

The CSS *:nth-child* pseudo-class selector offers an incredibly flexible method for targeting elements within a container. It can accept an integer as a parameter to select a specific child, or a formula in the format of *an+b* to select a repeating pattern of children.

Here are a few practical *:nth-child* recipes:


1. **Targeting Specific Elements**
	- Let’s assume :nth-child(3) is our selector.
	- Elements: ☐ ☐ ☑ ☐ ☐ ☐
2. **Targeting Even or Odd Elements**
	- With :nth-child(even):
	- Elements: ☐ ☑ ☐ ☑ ☐ ☑
	- With :nth-child(odd):
	- Elements: ☑ ☐ ☑ ☐ ☑ ☐
3. **Targeting a Pattern of Elements**
	- For :nth-child(4n+1), targeting every fourth element starting from the first one.
	- Elements: ☑ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☑ ☐ ☐ ☐
4. **Targeting Last Element**
	- Using :last-child:
	- Elements: ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☐ ☑
5. **Negation Pseudo-class**
	- For :not(:nth-child(2)), all children except the second one are selected.
	- Elements: ☑ ☐ ☑ ☑ ☑ ☑

👉 Remember: CSS counts elements starting from 1, not 0.
