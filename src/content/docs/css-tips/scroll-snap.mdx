## Scroll snap

The CSS scroll snap property allows you to provide a more predictable and controlled user experience by controlling the scrolling behavior of a container element by defining snap points (specific positions) within the scrollable area.


```css
.container ‹
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
｝ 
.container item {
  height: 100h;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
}
```
