### Inline block

Inline elements, such as anchor tags (`<a>`), are elements that are displayed on the same line as surrounding text or other inline elements, rather than starting on a new line. By default, inline elements do not have a width or height and do not respect top and bottom margins or padding. However, they do respect left and right margins and padding.

When it comes to setting margins for inline elements, the `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` properties do not work as expected. This means that if you try to add a top or bottom margin to an inline element like an anchor tag, it won't create any space above or below the element.

To overcome this limitation, you can use the `display` property with the value `inline-block`. By setting `display: inline-block` on an element, you make it behave like an inline element while still allowing you to apply properties such as width, height, margins, and padding to it.

When an element has `display: inline-block`, it retains the inline behavior of being placed on the same line as other inline elements, but it also gains the ability to have a width and height. Additionally, you can now set top and bottom margins on the element, and they will work as expected, creating space above and below the element.

Here's an example:

HTML:

```html
<a href="#" class="my-link">My Link</a>
```


CSS:

```css
.my-link {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```


In this example, the anchor tag will be displayed as an inline-block element, allowing you to set top and bottom margins of 10 pixels, which will create space above and below the link.

By using `display: inline-block`, you can control the dimensions and spacing of inline elements like anchor tags, making them more versatile in terms of layout and styling.
