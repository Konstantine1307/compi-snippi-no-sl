### Position fixed vs absolute

The main difference between `position: fixed;` and `position: absolute;` in CSS lies in how they are positioned relative to the document or the nearest positioned ancestor.


1. `position: fixed;`:
	- Elements with `position: fixed;` are positioned relative to the viewport (the browser window), regardless of whether the page is scrolled or not.
	- A fixed-position element is removed from the normal document flow, meaning it doesn't affect the positioning of other elements.
	- It stays in the same position even when the user scrolls the page.
	- To specify the position, you can use properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.
2. `position: absolute;`:
	- Elements with `position: absolute;` are positioned relative to their closest positioned ancestor, which is an element that has a position value of `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`.
	- If no positioned ancestor is found, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block, which is typically the viewport.
	- An absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal document flow, similar to `position: fixed;`.
	- It doesn't leave a space in the layout for itself, so other elements may overlap it.
	- You can use properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to specify the position.

Here's a summary of the key differences between `position: fixed;` and `position: absolute;`:


- `position: fixed;` positions an element relative to the viewport and is unaffected by scrolling, while `position: absolute;` positions an element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor or the initial containing block.
- Fixed-position elements stay in the same position even when the page is scrolled, while absolutely positioned elements scroll with their closest positioned ancestor.
- Both positions remove the element from the normal document flow, but absolute positioning can potentially affect the layout by overlapping other elements.

It's important to note that the positioning behavior of `position: fixed;` and `position: absolute;` can be altered by other CSS properties like `z-index` and the presence of transforms or stacking contexts.
