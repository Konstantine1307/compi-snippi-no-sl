title: Ellipse

### Basic ellipse() example

This example shows an ellipse with an x radius of 40%, a y radius of 50% and the position being left. This means that the center of the ellipse is on the left edge of the box giving us a half ellipse shape to wrap our text around. You can change these values to see how the ellipse changes.

  <p>One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all scientific knowledge and new discovery. Before that night—a memorable night, as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the rising smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any special inspiration from the fact.</p>
</div>

<!-- CSS -->

 <style>
  .shape {
  float: left;
  shape-outside: ellipse(40% 50% at left);
  margin: 20px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 200px;
}
</style>

```

### Using closes-side / farthest-side values

The keyword values of closest-side and farthest-side are useful to create a quick ellipse based on the size of the floated element reference box.
