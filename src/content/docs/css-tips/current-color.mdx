### currentColor property


An often overlooked trick is using the currentColor keyword. The magic here is it'll automatically inherit the current element's color value for other properties like border-color or background-color.

This is an easy way to reduce the need to repeat color values in your CSS code and keeps it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

```css
button {
color: #f06;
border: 2px solid currentColor;
/* border will inherit the color value from the 'color' property */
}
```
